# WRITING COMPLEX PIANO SCORES

With the Spontini editor it is possible to write complex scores for piano, combining polyphony and cross-staff, which is very common in music from (at least) the end of XIX century onwards.
Here we examine a fragment of a prelude to Debussy ("Danseuses de Delphes"), which can be downloaded from the **[IMSLP](https://imslp.org/wiki/Pr%C3%A9ludes%2C_Livre_1_(Debussy%2C_Claude))** website.

Spontini allows you to combine voices in polyphony with the cross-staff using the **\easyCrossStaffB** function, which adds up to 4 levels of polyphony, both to the upper and lower staff, in addition to the cross-staff layer.

In Debussy's prelude we can generally identify, in addition to a cross-staff layer, a polyphony layer on the lower staff and another layer on the upper staff.
For example, in the bar that follows, we identify the cross-staff layer with blue color, with red the additional voice on the upper staff and with green the additional voice on the lower staff.

The \easyCrossStaffB function can be obtained by pressing the **"Ctrl-2"** keys, adding the letter **"B"** to the word "\easyCrossStaff", positioning the cursor on the next line and pressing the **"Ctrl-3"** keys. The following expression will be generated:

```
\easyCrossStaffB %TMODE
  { s \CS }
  { s \CS }
#'( - \CS )
  %% UPPER STAFF %%
  {} {} {} {}
  %% LOWER STAFF %%
  {} {} {} {}
```

The first two { s \CS } expressions under "\easyCrossStaffB %TMODE" are reserved for the Cross-staff layer.
The four {} expressions under "UPPER STAFF" and "LOWER STAFF" allow you to enter as many additional voices in polyphony for each staff.
The first six bars of Debussy's prelude were made in **[THIS](easy-cross-staff-example-4.ly)** example. As you can see, given the complexity of the score, it was necessary to make further tuning of the graphic objects (curves, beams, dots, dynamics and accidentals) with the **\jsTweak**, **\jsOnceOffset** and **\jsShape** functions.

Here's the result:

When the notes of the two staves are in polyphony, but without cross-staff, you can also use the functions **\tabularTwoStavesPolyI/II/III/IV**
These functions are automatically generated by pressing the "Ctrl-1" keys, adding the letter "I" (or "II" or "III" or "IV") to the string \ tabularTwoStavesPoly, placing the cursor on the next line and pressing the keys " Ctrl-3 ". For example, in the case of \ tabularTwoStavesPolyII the following expression will be generated:

```
\tabularTwoStavesPolyII %TMODE
  { \CS }
  { \CS }% _
  { \CS }%
  { \CS }
```

All the rows in this table are automatically formatted by the editor, as it happens with the rows of the \easyCrossStaff table. By pressing "Ctrl-3", after placing the cursor on the first row of the table, you can add a new column. Look at **[THIS](tabular-poly-example.ly)** example to better understand.
